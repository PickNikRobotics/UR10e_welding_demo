   Description: Simple trajectory operator that samples the next global trajectory waypoint as local goal constraint
   based on the current robot state. When the waypoint is reached the index that marks the current local goal constraint
   is updated to the next global trajectory waypoint. Global trajectory updates simply replace the reference trajectory.
